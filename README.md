This is a rock, paper, scissors 2 player game enabled by the firebase database.

It is in progress. Currently the real-time chat is working and the game logic is sound. I need to restrict some conditions in the game 
flow and also add more aesthetic battle and result scenes. Also the detection of presence through firebase which will allow for only
2 players (or maybe an even number of players) at a time and keeping track of logins and identities of player 1 and 2. Would be nice
to add a login so as to keep track of the player's all time win/loss record.
